# Islandora Enterprise (ISLE)

ISLE is a community developed project that supports a set of [Docker](https://docker.com) images–which run as containers (virtual servers)–and provides a fully functioning [Islandora](https://islandora.ca) platform for production, staging, and development  digital repositories. 

This documentation provides friendly and clear instructions on how to do the following types of installations and updates:

* [Demo ISLE Site](install/host-hardware-requirements.md): Quickly create a new Islandora platform on your personal computer for testing or local development.

* [New ISLE Site](install/host-hardware-requirements.md): Create a new Islandora platform that can be used as a production, staging, or development environment. This process assumes you are starting fresh and **do not** have an existing Islandora installation you wish to migrate.

* [Update ISLE Site](update/update.md): Update your version of ISLE to the latest release and receive improvements and security updates.

* [Migrate to ISLE Site](install/host-hardware-requirements.md): Migrate a non-ISLE Islandora 7.x platform to ISLE for use as a production, staging, or development environment.
