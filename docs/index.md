# Islandora Enterprise (ISLE)

Welcome to the documentation for ISLE, a set of resources for building a fully functioning Islandora system quickly using a system building tool called [Docker](https://docker.com). This documentation aims to cover every feature of ISLE from end-to-end, covering as much detail as possible. If you are just getting started with ISLE, please review the [Installation Start Here](install_start_here.md) first.

The navigation to the left will take you through all the components of ISLE as well as various examples and step-by-step instructions for spinning up an Islandora instance using ISLE. For details about how ISLE came into being please read the [ISLE Executive Summary](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17tAFxR6_b7sxXkE1teNDQZv0UZ0LLSkX8K05-U6A6nw/edit?usp=sharing) (a concise overview in plain English)
