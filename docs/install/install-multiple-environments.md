# New Site Installation: Multiple ISLE Environments

Please see the readme.md file at the [Multi-Environment Repository](https://github.com/Islandora-Collaboration-Group/ISLE-Multi-Environment) for instructions on setting up development, staging and production environments on a single server


---

* [New Site Installation: Single ISLE Environment](install/install-one-environment.md) - Setup **one** ISLE site within a single environment (e.g. production only) or run all of your ISLE environments on separate ISLE host servers or VMs.
* [New Site Installation: Multiple ISLE Environments](install/install-multiple-environments.md) - Setup **multiple** ISLE sites using multiple environments (e.g. development, staging, and production) on one ISLE Host server or VM.  Note: setting up multiple ISLE sites and environments on one ISLE host server will require adequate resources. A rough estimate is to use the [Hardware Requirements](install/host-hardware-requirements.md) and multiply by three. Please note that a `dev` environment needs fewer resources, but `stage` and `prod` environments should mirror each other in resource usage and setup.
