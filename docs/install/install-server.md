# Remote Server ISLE Installation

_Expectations:  It may take at least **4 - 6 hours or more** to read this documentation and complete this installation. Please proceed slowly._

This Remote Server ISLE Installation creates an Islandora environment with a unique domain (URL) on your host server, virtual machine, or cloud hosted platform.
You may also use this documentation to install ISLE on several host servers, virtual machines, or cloud hosted platforms to create multiple Islandora environments (e.g. development, staging, and production). This process will result in an un-themed Drupal website and an empty Fedora repository. (Please refer back to the [Hardware Requirements](../install/host-hardware-requirements.md) as the development environment needs fewer resources than the staging and production environments; the latter two should mirror each other in resource usage and setup.)

Please post questions to the public [Islandora ISLE Google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/islandora-isle), or subscribe to receive emails. The [Glossary](../appendices/glossary.md) defines terms used in this documentation.

## Assumptions / Prerequisites

* You have already completed the [Hardware Requirements](../install/host-hardware-requirements.md) and the [Software Dependencies](../install/host-software-dependencies.md) for your host server. 

* SSL Certificates: Use the [Let's Encrypt guide](../appendices/configuring-lets-encrypt.md) to generate SSL Certificates or ask your IT resource to provision [SSL Certificates](../appendices/glossary.md#systems) for the web domain.

* **Never ever share or post your .env files publicly.** The .env and tomcat.env files ("Docker Environment files") are your primary resources for customizing your ISLE stack. These .env files contain passwords and usernames and must be treated with the utmost care.

## Setup GIT Workflow

### Create Two Private Institutional GIT Repositories

Note: Since public forks canâ€™t be made private, we will duplicate (instead of forking) the repository to enable them to be private.

1. Create a PRIVATE remote git repository on your institution's GitHub account (or Bitbucket) and name it: `[project-name]-ISLE` (example: `digital-ISLE`). Leave this repository empty.
2. Create another PRIVATE remote git repository on your institution's GitHub account (or Bitbucket) and name it: `[project-name]-islandora` (example: `digital-islandora`). Leave this repository empty.

### Set your Remotes: Upstream and Origin

* Open a terminal and navigate to `/opt/ISLE` (or where you cloned the ISLE directory).
* Type `git remote -v`
* You want to have four lines returned, two that describe your private repository (called `origin`) and two that describe the source ISLE github site (called `upstream`):

```
origin  https://github.com/dwk2/ISLE-Documentation.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/dwk2/ISLE-Documentation.git (push)
upstream        https://github.com/Islandora-Collaboration-Group/ISLE.git (fetch)
upstream        https://github.com/Islandora-Collaboration-Group/ISLE.git (push)
```

* If the name of the `https://github.com/Islandora-Collaboration-Group/ISLE.git` is not `upstream`, then please correct that:
    * Remove the non-upstream name: `git remote rm non-upstream-name-here`
    * Rename it to be "upstream": `git remote add upstream https://github.com/Islandora-Collaboration-Group/ISLE`
  
* Add your private insitutional repository as the remote `origin`.
    * In the line below, substitute `your-institution` and "project-name", then enter it in your terminal.
    `git remote add origin https://github.com/your-institution/project-name-ISLE`

* Pull from the remote upstream master and update the remote origin master branch.
    * Pull from upstream: `git pull upstream master`
    * Git will ask you to authenicate with username and password:
        * $> Username for 'https://github.com': your-github-name
        * $> Password for 'https://your-github-name@github.com': xxxxx
        * TODO: Lookup how to have your server remember your pwd and link to that here.
        * TODO: Do you have 2-factor auth set up for github?
            * No - okay, enter your github account username and pwd
            * Yes - have to setup keys (link to how to do that..)

    * Push to origin: `git push -u origin master` (-u is a one-time command that sets up tracking for branches)

* Done: You have now setup your server to consider ICG as upstream and "[project-name]-ISLE" as origin.
  
* General outline of Git Workflow:
    * Work on local
    * Pull from upstream master
    * Push to origin master
    * On development, staging, and production environments: pull from your single institutional git repository (e.g. williamscollege/unbound-ISLE)


## Docker Environment Files (.env)

* Edit the .env file and change the values of COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME, BASE_DOMAIN, and CONTAINER_SHORT_ID. e.g. for a production site you may use:

    `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=isleproduction`

    `BASE_DOMAIN=mydomain.edu`

    `CONTAINER_SHORT_ID=prod`

**Please note:** Much of the file is already with comments guiding the end user to key areas or files to edit or modify accordingly.


### Master Section
    * COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME to something unique (e.g. `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=isle-production-collections`)
      * This variable is appended to Docker objects like: volume names, network names.
    * BASE_DOMAIN to your domainname (e.g. `BASE_DOMAIN=project-name.yourdomain.edu`)
      * This variable specifies your domain name!
    * CONTAINER_SHORT_ID to something unique (e.g. `CONTAINER_SHORT_ID=prod`).
      * This variable is appended to the end of all running containers, keep it _short_!


<!-- 
TODO: 

FLOW of Customization:

If New Installation....
- Explain that ISLE creates the mysql, fedora, etc. servers from Docker images, and that data for these can be stored with persistence on a bind mount.
  - Explain how to update usernames and passwords for mysql, fedora, etc.

If Migrate to ISLE Environment...
- Explain how to find pwds, how to rsync data:
  - mysql, fedora installations on bind mount
  - usernames and passwords for mysql, fedora, etc.

Explain Git Workflow and how to setup

Explain how to setup bind mounts OR volumes? (are these docker volumes?)

-->

[Environment Files](../appendices/environment-files.md) - Tables contain important user names that relate to mysql and fedora and drupal databases.

## Config Directory

The config directory has many purposes like holding customized configuration files mounted to specific containers (which we have no covered here), but for a single simple site we only use it to hold our proxy configs and as a place to store our SSL Certificate and Key.

---

## Edit File `docker-compose.yml`

**For Production and Staging Servers Only:** Open the `docker-compose.yml` file and modify the environment variables called JAVA_MAX_MEM and JAVA_MIN_MEM for fedora, solr, and image-services.

```yaml
fedora:
  ...
  environment:
    - JAVA_MAX_MEM=2048M
    - JAVA_MIN_MEM=256M
...

solr:
  ...
  environment:
    - JAVA_MAX_MEM=2048M
    - JAVA_MIN_MEM=256M
...

image-services:
  ...
  environment:
    - JAVA_MAX_MEM=2048M
    - JAVA_MIN_MEM=128M
```

## Proxy Directory

If need be, please refer to the **Systems** section of the [Glossary](../appendices/glossary.md) for relevant terms to help guide installation.

The `proxy` subdirectory contains all specific configurations necessary for the Traefik proxy to function properly with your changes.

If need be, please refer to the **SSL certificate** section of the [Glossary](../appendices/glossary.md) for relevant terms to help guide installation.

There are also additional links for the end user to learn how to combine the SSL Certificate File with any available SSL Certificate Chain File for the `proxy` process to work properly.

**If you followed the [Let's Encrypt](../appendices/configuring-lets-encrypt.md) configuration guide, you can skip to the next section: Spin up ISLE containers**

* Copy your SSL certificates for the ISLE Proxy into `config/proxy/ssl-certs`. They will and should have different names than the examples provided below.

    * There can only be 2 files involved in this process.

        * 1 x SSL Certificate Key File e.g. `newsite-sample-key.pem`
            * This file is required.
            * Please also note that the file extensions can also be: `.key` or `.pem`

        * 1 x SSL Certificate File e.g. `newsite-sample.pem`
            * This file is required.
            * Please also note that the file extensions can also be: `.cer`, `.crt` or `.pem`

* Edit the `config/proxy/traefik.toml` file:
  * Change line 27 and 28:
    *  `certFile = "/certs/newsite-sample.cert"`  ## Change to reflect your CERT, CRT, or PEM
    *  `keyFile = "/certs/newsite-sample-key.key"`  ## Change to reflect your KEY, or PEM.


---

## Spin up ISLE Containers!

* Run `docker-compose up -d`

* Wait for the stack to completely initialize, about 5 minutes (typically much less).

* Run `docker exec -it isle-apache-<CONTAINER_SHORT_ID> bash /utility-scripts/isle_drupal_build_tools/isle_islandora_installer.sh`
     * Using the <CONTAINER_SHORT_ID> value from the .env file here (_typically: isle-apache-prod, or -stage, -dev, etc._)

* Give this process 15 - 25 minutes (_depending on the speed of the ISLE Host server internet connection_)

* Check the newly created and running new site by opening a browser and navigating to your site domain e.g. `https://project-name.yourdomain.edu`, you should now see an un-themed Drupal site.

---


(Good points for somewhere else:)

- ISLE removes the need to manually edit the more complex config files that are part of the Islandora stack. 

---

## Additional Resources
* TBD: [Demo ISLE Installation: Resources](../install/install-demo-resources.md) contains Docker container passwords and URLs for administrator tools.
* TBD: [Demo ISLE Installation: Troubleshooting](../install/install-demo-troubleshooting.md) contains help for port conflicts, non-running Docker containers, etc.

## Migrate to ISLE Environment 
* Please click [Migrate to ISLE Environment](../migrate/install-migration.md) if you are installing ISLE to migrate your existing production Islandora 7.x environment to an ISLE environment. This documentation will help you identify and copy your institution's preexisting Islandora data, files, and themes (including your data volume, Drupal site(s) and theme(s), and commonly customized xml and xslt files) to your ISLE environment.
