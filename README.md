## What is Islandora Enterprise (ISLE)?
ISLE is a new project in development -- funded by 17 higher-ed institutions and Born-Digital -- that will address one of the most significant pain-points in Islandora: installation and maintenance. ISLE separates an institution’s customizations from core code, and moves that core code into Docker containers that are easily updated, simplifying and largely automating the process of installation and updates/maintenance of Islandora. ISLE also bundles together the best shared modules into a common, production-ready and security-hardened platform.

## Why is it needed?
Islandora is a powerful digital repository comprised of over 80 different, best-of-breed open-source software libraries. Islandora’s strength is that it integrates these packages into one easy to manage system. However, this ecosystem has traditionally been complex enough as to require staff with technical expertise to install and maintain.

ISLE lowers the barrier to entry for new institutions or organizations because it reduces the complexity and expense to the point where non-technical staff can maintain an Islandora stack in just a few hours per quarter. This in turn allows institutions to reallocate funds towards development or ingestion instead of maintenance. As an additional bonus, an ISLE maintained Islandora stack is secure enough to run on both development and production servers.

## Staff and setup
- ISLE is designed to completely remove any technical barriers to setting up an Islandora stack. With a little reading ANYONE can do it without requiring expensive vendor support.
- First-time Islandora installations can use ISLE to install Islandora and ISLE updates for maintenance
- Pre-existing Islandora installations must, prior to installing ISLE, prepare their installation using provided documentation to store their current customizations and settings for ISLE (or, ask a vendor do that work), after which they may use ISLE updates for maintenance

## How can you help?
- Discuss ISLE’s ease of use and cost savings with your CIO and/or Library Director
- Participate in the [ISLE Updates google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/isle-updates)
- Pledge funding to refactor ISLE for Islandora CLAW (Phase II)
- Spread the word about ISLE at conferences
